    <h1>Reflections on Foundation Core Skills</h1>
    
    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and 
      your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>That I unconsciously have a growth mindset for some things but not for others. 
        Being mindful of it have been helpful in recognising whenever I’m limiting myself.</li>

      <li>That emotional intelligence is something I have to keep on 
        developing throughout my life together with developing my mind and skills.</li>

      <li>I’m not very good at truly listening and it’s something I need to work on more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
    <p>
      Learning does not happen in a vacuum and gone are the days where programmers sit in a room alone and merely crank out code after code after code.
      We need to have empathy, integrity and self-awareness as programmers because we create our applications with other people (teammates) for other people (customers).
    </p>

    <p>
        Our values, as well as having empathy and self-awareness, are what will guide us into becoming not just adequate programmers 
        but rather programmers who will create applications that are inclusive and enjoyed by many.
    </p>

    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      That it’s not offered in other institutions. It seems like a no-brainer that these skills are needed by everyone not just because 
      they’re needed in the workplace but more importantly because it makes you a better individual and can help you in your day-to-day life.
    </p>

    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      Finding the time for it. Oftentimes, I focus too much on learning the technical skills that I need that 
      I don’t put in the attention and effort that I need to for the core learning which is just as important.
    </p>

    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
    <p>
        To set your students up for success. Employers don’t only look at technical skills, the ability to work in teams, 
        teach yourself, handle stress, time management, listening and understanding and other core skills are just as important as how well you can code. 
        Especially in the modern work environment, having these skills set you apart from other people.
    </p>

    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
    <p>
      No, as I was doing the course full-time I had enough time for both the technical and core aspects of the curriculum.
