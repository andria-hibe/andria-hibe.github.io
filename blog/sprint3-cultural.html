    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h3>17 September 2019</h3>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence (or the Emotional Quotient or EQ) refers to the ability of an individual to identify, apply, and manage their own as well as others' emotions.
      Generally speaking, this is how most individuals navigate social communication - by interpreting the information gleaned from your own emotions as well as that of others, it provides a sort of guide on how one should navigate a particular situation or landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people are aware of IQ and may get confued about how EQ is different from it.
      EQ is about identifying emotions within yourself and others, and by empathising and relating to others by way of communicating your feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      IQ or Intelligence Quotient is about cognitive intelligence. This refers to an individual's ability to learn and apply information.
      Logical reasoning, comprehension, abstract and spatial thinking, and arithmetic skills all fall under this umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      While an individual's IQ can be a good indicator of whether they will be successful in a particular field or task, their EQ is just as important to that success as well.
      As we live in a society that requires us to traverse varied social landscapes, a developed EQ is a necessity.
      A developed EQ is an indicator that an individual is a good team player and will fit harmoniously in a group despite its composition, and will also be just as capable to work and motivate themselves.
